## Is Elon Musk that influential? 

**The aim of this project itÂ´s to check if the increased on the price of cryptocurrencies are related with the tweets of Elon Musk, and of course to know more about the evolution on this market in the last months.** In order to achieve the goal of this project I have joined two databases one from yahoo finance with cryptocurrency information and othe one with the tweets of Elon Musk.

As I was saying I create a database with the information of yahoo finance about cryptocurrencies, to get this information I used the method of web scrapping, so I was abled to create a full table compiling this information. On the other hand I download a database with the tweets historical data of Elon Musk here you can find the url: (https://www.kaggle.com/ayhmrba/elon-musk-tweets-2010-2021)

To elaborate and clean the databases I have used some really usefull libraries:
- requests: https://docs.python-requests.org/es/latest/
- BeautifulSoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
- Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- Datetime: https://www.php.net/manual/es/class.datetime.php
- Re: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

Note: In the repo you will find Creating_final_table.py that creates the final table (the one with the yahoo finance and the tweets information), five different Jupiters, Cleaning_tweets_final.ipynb(cleans the tweets dataset), Join_tables.ipynb(Join both tables, Tweets and Yahoo Finance), WebScrapping.ipynb(creates a database based on Yahoo Finance), Visualization.ipynb(Creates all the graphs for better understanding) . Also you can find the data (.csv) and the images.

The final version of the database is composed of:

   - DATE:
   - OPEN:
   - MAX_V: 
   - MIN_V:
   - CLOSE: 
   - VOLUME: 
   - CRYPTO: 
   - TWEET: 
   - KEY_TWEET:
